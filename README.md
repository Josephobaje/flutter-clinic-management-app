**MediCare NG** is an offline Flutter portfolio demo by Joseph Obaje. It runs standalone with built-in mock Nigerian data — no server, account, API key or real money is involved. Fees, bills and prices are shown in Naira (₦) where relevant.

## Features

- Patient records with visit history
- Appointment queue: waiting, in consultation, done
- Pharmacy stock with low stock alerts
- Billing: consultation plus drugs plus lab in Naira

- Material 3 UI that works on Android, iOS and web
- Business logic kept in `lib/logic.dart` and covered by unit tests

## Tech stack

```

## Going live

Use this demo as the front end for a real system: persist data with a local database or your REST API, add authenticated roles per user type, and move payments to a server-verified gateway (for example Paystack) so secrets never ship in the app.
